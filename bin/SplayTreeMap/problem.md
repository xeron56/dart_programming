Sure! Let's consider a real-life problem where a `SplayTreeMap` can be utilized effectively:

**Problem: Event Scheduling**

Suppose you are organizing a series of events over a period of time, and you need to efficiently manage the scheduling of these events to ensure there are no conflicts in the timings. Each event has a start time and an end time.

Here's how you can use a `SplayTreeMap` to solve this problem:

1. **Data Representation**: Represent each event with its start time as the key and its end time as the value in the `SplayTreeMap`. This allows you to quickly retrieve events based on their start times, which are sorted naturally in ascending order.

2. **Conflict Detection**: As you add events to the `SplayTreeMap`, you can check for conflicts with existing events. If the start time of a new event falls within the time range of an existing event, it indicates a scheduling conflict.

3. **Efficient Retrieval**: With the events sorted by start time in the `SplayTreeMap`, you can efficiently retrieve events within a specific time range or find the next available time slot for scheduling a new event.

4. **Dynamic Updates**: If there are changes to the event schedule, such as rescheduling or cancelling events, you can easily update the `SplayTreeMap` accordingly without needing to re-sort the events.

```dart
import 'dart:collection';

void main() {
  // Create a SplayTreeMap to manage event scheduling
  final eventSchedule = SplayTreeMap<int, int>();

  // Add events to the schedule
  addEvent(eventSchedule, 900, 1000);  // Event 1: 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM
  addEvent(eventSchedule, 1030, 1100); // Event 2: 10:30 AM - 11:00 AM
  addEvent(eventSchedule, 930, 1100);  // Event 3: 9:30 AM - 11:00 AM (Conflict)

  // Check for conflicts when adding events
  bool hasConflict = checkForConflict(eventSchedule, 930, 1100); // Should return true
  print('Conflict Detected: $hasConflict');

  // Find the next available time slot after 11:00 AM
  int nextAvailableTime = findNextAvailableTime(eventSchedule, 1100);
  print('Next Available Time: $nextAvailableTime'); // Should return 1100 (11:00 AM)
}

// Function to add an event to the schedule
void addEvent(SplayTreeMap<int, int> schedule, int startTime, int endTime) {
  // Check for conflicts
  if (checkForConflict(schedule, startTime, endTime)) {
    print('Scheduling Conflict: Unable to add event from $startTime to $endTime');
  } else {
    schedule[startTime] = endTime;
    print('Event scheduled from $startTime to $endTime');
  }
}

// Function to check for conflicts with existing events
bool checkForConflict(SplayTreeMap<int, int> schedule, int startTime, int endTime) {
  // Iterate through events to check for conflicts
  for (var entry in schedule.entries) {
    if (entry.key <= startTime && startTime < entry.value) {
      return true; // Conflict detected
    }
    if (entry.key < endTime && endTime <= entry.value) {
      return true; // Conflict detected
    }
  }
  return false; // No conflicts found
}

// Function to find the next available time slot after a given time
int findNextAvailableTime(SplayTreeMap<int, int> schedule, int time) {
  // Iterate through events to find the next available time slot
  for (var entry in schedule.entries) {
    if (entry.key > time) {
      return entry.key; // Next available time found
    }
  }
  return time; // No events scheduled after the given time
}
```

In this example, the `SplayTreeMap` is used to manage event scheduling efficiently. It allows for easy addition of events, conflict detection, and retrieval of available time slots, making it a suitable solution for organizing events in a real-life scenario.
