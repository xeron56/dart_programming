Sure, here's a comparison table highlighting the differences between `LinkedHashSet` and `HashSet` in Dart:

| Feature           | LinkedHashSet                                         | HashSet                                              |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Order Preservation| Maintains insertion order of elements                | Order of elements is not preserved                   |
| Implementation    | Implemented as a hash-table based set                | Implemented as a hash-table based set                |
| Iteration         | Iteration happens in first-to-last insertion order   | Iteration order not guaranteed                        |
| Element Equality  | Elements must have consistent `==` and `hashCode`    | Elements must have consistent `==` and `hashCode`    |
| Performance       | Mostly constant time for basic operations            | Mostly constant time for basic operations            |
| Use Case          | When maintaining order of insertion is important      | When order of elements is not important              |
| Constructors      | `LinkedHashSet()`<br>`LinkedHashSet.from(iterable)`  | `HashSet()`<br>`HashSet.from(iterable)`              |

These are some of the key differences between `LinkedHashSet` and `HashSet` in Dart. Depending on the requirements of your application, you can choose the appropriate set implementation.
