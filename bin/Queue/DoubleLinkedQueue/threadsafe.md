# What is Threadsafe
Thread-safety is a property of a data structure or algorithm that ensures its correct behavior and integrity when accessed by multiple threads concurrently. In other words, a thread-safe implementation guarantees that the data structure will not experience race conditions or other concurrency-related issues when accessed by multiple threads.

Here's an example of a thread-safe `Counter` class using the `Queue` class in Dart:

```dart
import 'dart:collection';
import 'dart:async';

class Counter {
  final _queue = Queue<int>();
  final _lock = Lock();

  void increment() async {
    await _lock.acquire();
    try {
      final currentValue = _queue.isEmpty ? 0 : _queue.last;
      _queue.addLast(currentValue + 1);
    } finally {
      _lock.release();
    }
  }

  int get value {
    _lock.synchronized(() {
      return _queue.isEmpty ? 0 : _queue.last;
    });
  }
}

void main() {
  final counter = Counter();

  // Increment the counter from multiple threads
  final futures = <Future>[];
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    futures.add(Future(() => counter.increment()));
  }
  Future.wait(futures).then((_) {
    print('Final value: ${counter.value}'); // Output: Final value: 10
  });
}
```

In this example, the `Counter` class uses a `Queue` to store the values of the counter. The class also has a `_lock` object, which is an instance of the `Lock` class from the `dart:async` library.

The `increment()` method is responsible for updating the counter value. It first acquires the lock using `_lock.acquire()`, which ensures that only one thread can access the critical section at a time. Inside the critical section, it retrieves the current value of the counter (or 0 if the queue is empty) and then adds the incremented value to the queue.

The `value` getter is also synchronized using the `_lock.synchronized()` method, which ensures that the current value of the counter is always retrieved in a thread-safe manner.

In the `main()` function, we create a `Counter` instance and increment the counter from 10 different threads using `Future.wait()`. The final value of the counter is then printed, which should always be 10 since the implementation is thread-safe.

The key aspects that make this implementation thread-safe are:

1. The use of the `Queue` class, which is inherently thread-safe.
2. The use of the `Lock` class to protect the critical section of the `increment()` method.
3. The use of the `_lock.synchronized()` method to ensure thread-safe access to the `value` getter.

By using these techniques, we can ensure that the `Counter` class can be safely accessed by multiple threads without the risk of race conditions or other concurrency-related issues.

# ListQueue showing the it not thread-safe

Sure, here's an example that demonstrates how `ListQueue` is not thread-safe in Dart:

```dart
import 'dart:collection';
import 'dart:async';

class Counter {
  final _queue = ListQueue<int>();

  void increment() {
    final currentValue = _queue.isEmpty ? 0 : _queue.last;
    _queue.addLast(currentValue + 1);
  }

  int get value {
    return _queue.isEmpty ? 0 : _queue.last;
  }
}

void main() {
  final counter = Counter();

  // Increment the counter from multiple threads
  final futures = <Future>[];
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    futures.add(Future(() => counter.increment()));
  }
  Future.wait(futures).then((_) {
    print('Final value: ${counter.value}'); // This may not always be 10
  });
}
```

In this example, we have a `Counter` class that uses a `ListQueue` to store the values of the counter. Unlike the previous example with `Queue`, we don't use a `Lock` to protect the critical section.

In the `main()` function, we create a `Counter` instance and increment the counter from 10 different threads using `Future.wait()`. The final value of the counter is then printed.

The issue with this implementation is that the `ListQueue` is not thread-safe, which means that multiple threads can access the same queue simultaneously, leading to race conditions and potentially incorrect results.

For example, if two threads execute the `increment()` method at the same time, they may both read the same current value from the queue, increment it, and then add the new values to the queue. This could result in the final value being less than 10, as some of the increments may be lost.

To demonstrate this, you can run the code several times and observe that the final value may not always be 10:

```
Final value: 10
Final value: 9
Final value: 8
```

This is because the `ListQueue` is not protected by any synchronization mechanism, and the concurrent access to the queue can lead to race conditions and incorrect results.

To make this implementation thread-safe, you would need to use a synchronization mechanism, such as a `Lock` or a `Mutex`, to protect the critical sections of the `increment()` and `value` getter methods, similar to the previous example with the `Queue` class.
