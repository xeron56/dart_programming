Here is a table of all the Constructors, Properties, and Methods of the `List` class in Dart, along with a brief description of what they do:

| Type | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Constructors** |
| `List.empty()` | Creates a new empty list. |
| `List.filled()` | Creates a list of the given length with a specific fill value. |
| `List.from()` | Creates a list containing all elements from an iterable. |
| `List.generate()` | Generates a list of values using a provided generator function. |
| `List.of()` | Creates a list from an iterable, preserving the element types. |
| `List.unmodifiable()` | Creates an unmodifiable list containing all elements from an iterable. |
| **Properties** |
| `first` | The first element of the list. |
| `last` | The last element of the list. |
| `length` | The number of elements in the list. |
| `isEmpty` | Whether the list has no elements. |
| `isNotEmpty` | Whether the list has at least one element. |
| `iterator` | An iterator that allows iterating over the elements of the list. |
| `reversed` | An iterable that iterates over the elements of the list in reverse order. |
| `single` | The single element of the list (throws if the list has more or less than one element). |
| `hashCode` | The hash code for the list. |
| `runtimeType` | The runtime type of the list. |
| **Methods** |
| `add()` | Adds a value to the end of the list. |
| `addAll()` | Appends all elements of an iterable to the end of the list. |
| `any()` | Checks whether any element of the list satisfies a given predicate. |
| `asMap()` | Creates an unmodifiable map view of the list. |
| `cast()` | Returns a view of this list as a list of instances of type `R`. |
| `clear()` | Removes all objects from the list. |
| `contains()` | Checks whether the list contains a given element. |
| `elementAt()` | Returns the element at the given index. |
| `every()` | Checks whether every element of the list satisfies a given predicate. |
| `expand()` | Expands each element of this iterable into zero or more elements. |
| `fillRange()` | Overwrites a range of elements with a given value. |
| `firstWhere()` | Returns the first element that satisfies the given predicate. |
| `fold()` | Reduces a collection to a single value by iteratively combining each element. |
| `followedBy()` | Creates the lazy concatenation of this iterable and another iterable. |
| `forEach()` | Applies an operation to each element of the list. |
| `getRange()` | Creates an iterable that iterates over a range of elements. |
| `indexOf()` | Returns the first index of the given element in the list. |
| `indexWhere()` | Returns the index of the first element that satisfies the given predicate. |
| `insert()` | Inserts an element at the given index. |
| `insertAll()` | Inserts all elements of an iterable at the given index. |
| `join()` | Converts each element to a string and concatenates the strings. |
| `lastIndexOf()` | Returns the last index of the given element in the list. |
| `lastIndexWhere()` | Returns the index of the last element that satisfies the given predicate. |
| `lastWhere()` | Returns the last element that satisfies the given predicate. |
| `remove()` | Removes the first occurrence of the given value. |
| `removeAt()` | Removes and returns the element at the given index. |
| `removeLast()` | Removes and returns the last element. |
| `removeRange()` | Removes the elements in the given range. |
| `removeWhere()` | Removes all elements that satisfy the given predicate. |
| `replaceRange()` | Replaces the elements in the given range with the given replacements. |
| `retainWhere()` | Removes all elements that fail to satisfy the given predicate. |
| `setAll()` | Overwrites the elements at the given positions with the elements of the given iterable. |
| `setRange()` | Writes the elements of an iterable into a range of this list. |
| `shuffle()` | Shuffles the elements of the list randomly. |
| `skip()` | Creates an iterable that provides all but the first `count` elements. |
| `skipWhile()` | Creates an iterable that skips leading elements while a given condition is true. |
| `sort()` | Sorts the elements of the list according to the order specified by a compare function. |
| `sublist()` | Returns a new list containing the elements in the given range. |
| `take()` | Creates an iterable that provides the first `count` elements. |
| `takeWhile()` | Creates an iterable that provides elements as long as a given condition is true. |
| `toList()` | Creates a new list containing the elements of this iterable. |
| `toSet()` | Creates a new set containing the unique elements of this iterable. |
| `where()` | Creates a new lazy iterable with all elements that satisfy the given predicate. |
| `whereType()` | Creates a new lazy iterable with all elements that have type `T`. |

This table provides a comprehensive overview of the various Constructors, Properties, and Methods available in the `List` class, allowing you to quickly reference and understand their purpose and functionality.
